# list-everything
A (very) simple application to list everything. I'm just testing AngularJS (and this is my first repo), but I'd like to go further.

To Do:
- Add/Delete items
- Drag & Drop for ordering items
- Nested items
- Save lists on json files
- Share lists
- User registration for lists managing

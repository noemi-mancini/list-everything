# list-everything
A (very) simple application to list everything. I'm just testing AngularJS and GIT (this is my first repo).

Installed with Bower: AngularJS

To Do:
- Add/Delete items
- Drag & Drop for ordering items
- Nested items
- Save lists on json files
- Share lists
- User registration for lists managing
